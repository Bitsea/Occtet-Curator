    <h1>Occtet Curator – User Manual</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

    <h3>1.1 What is Occtet Curator?</h3>
    Occtet Curator is a professional platform for analyzing, curating, and assessing SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials).

    An SBOM describes which software components a project consists of. This information forms the basis for:
    - Security assessments (CVEs, vulnerabilities)
    - License compliance
    - Copyright analysis
    - Supply chain risk assessment

    Occtet Curator breaks down an SBOM into individual, verifiable units and makes them manageable for human review. The central object in this process is the <b>InventoryItem</b>.

    <h2>2. Core Principle: How Occtet Works</h2>
    Occtet Curator always works on a project basis:
    1. Create a project
    2. Import an SBOM
    3. Analyze the project
    4. Review InventoryItems
    5. Validate files, licenses, and copyrights
    6. Assess vulnerabilities (VEX)
    7. Export results

    The system is designed to transform a raw SBOM into a verified, audit-ready software inventory.

    <h2>3. Projects</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Creating a Project</h3>
    When creating a project, you specify:
    - Name
    - Working directory
    - Optional metadata such as version, customer, or product

    Into the project directory:
    - the source code
    - and its dependencies
    are copied or referenced. This directory is the basis for:
    - file analysis
    - copyright scanning
    - license checks

    <h3>3.2 Importing an SBOM</h3>
    You can import an SBOM (e.g., SPDX or CycloneDX). During import, you can configure whether AI workflows should be used for:
    - copyright detection
    - license attribution
    - file assignment

    After import, Occtet creates:
    - SoftwareComponents
    - InventoryItems
    - file assignments
    - initial vulnerability information

    <h2>4. Dashboard</h2>
    The dashboard is your security traffic light. It shows, for example:
    - number of critical CVEs
    - open vulnerabilities
    - percentage of reviewed files
    - risk trends

    This allows you to immediately see: "Is this project currently release-ready or a risk?"

    <h2>5. SBOM Management</h2>
    This is your main working area. You see:
    - on the left: the file tree
    - on the right: the InventoryItems

    Ideally, each file belongs to exactly one InventoryItem.

    <h2>6. InventoryItems – The Core Element</h2>
    An InventoryItem represents a software component. It contains:
    - SoftwareComponent (name, version, origin)
    - Associated files
    - Vulnerabilities (CVEs)
    - Licenses
    - Copyrights
    - AuditNotes
    - VEX entries

    Typical examples:
    - OpenSSL 3.0.2
    - Log4j 2.17.1
    - A proprietary project module

    <h2>7. Working with Files</h2>
    <h3>7.1 Code Viewer</h3>
    You can open, read, and search any file and compare it with its InventoryItem. You can see:
    - license headers
    - copyright notices
    - indications of third-party code

    <h3>7.2 Reviewed Status</h3>
    A file is considered reviewed if:
    - it is assigned to the correct InventoryItem
    - its license has been checked
    - its copyrights have been checked
    - all findings have been documented

    After that, it is marked as reviewed.

    <h2>8. AuditNotes</h2>
    AuditNotes are your memory and your evidence. Here you document, for example:
    - why a license is acceptable
    - why a CVE is considered not relevant
    - why a copyright can be ignored

    They are essential for:
    - ISO audits
    - customer inquiries
    - legal evidence

    <h2>9. Vulnerabilities & VEX</h2>
    Occtet automatically detects which CVEs belong to a SoftwareComponent. You decide via VEX whether it is:
    - Affected
    - Not Affected
    - Under Investigation
    - Fixed

    These statements can be exported in a machine-readable format.

    <h2>10. Views & Overviews</h2>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>View</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Inventory</td>
            <td>All InventoryItems</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>VEX Listing</td>
            <td>All VEX decisions</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Licenses</td>
            <td>All licenses in the project</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>SoftwareComponents</td>
            <td>Technical components</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Projects</td>
            <td>All projects</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    All lists can be filtered, sorted, and searched.

    <h2>11. Export</h2>
    You can export:
    - cleaned SBOMs
    - VEX documents
    - license reports
    - audit evidence

    This allows you to:
    - deliver to customers
    - integrate with CI/CD
    - serve authorities or auditors

    <h2>12. Administration</h2>
    Administrators can:
    - manage users
    - assign roles
    - configure AI workflows
    - automate import jobs
    - review logs
